    "\n",
    "## Learning Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to get you familar with some of the foundational mathematical and programming tools used in deep learning, so we will review a little bit of calculus and linear algebra and introduce you to the pytorch API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already be familiar with pytorch, and if so, great - dive in to answer the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to pytorch, your first step is to get the necessary background.  **Read and work through the notebooks in the [David's tips on how to read pytorch](https://github.com/davidbau/how-to-read-pytorch) series**, which will give you an overview of GPU usage, Autograd, optimizer classes, torch Modules, and data loading.  (Don't hand in those notebooks; no points for working through those other notebooks, though they are highly recommended and will be helpful for learning to answer the questions in the current notebook.) Hand in this current notebook completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "The following readings are not necessary to do this notebook, but you may find them interesting if you want to develop your sense for the origins of some of the important ideas in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice of modeling a neural network as a computational object was pioneered in this classic paper by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, and we will follow along with some of their constructions envisioning neural networks as graphs that can implement logic:\n",

    "<em>A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity</em>, 1943.\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch is pretty new, but its modular architecture has a long history, with roots in the torch project, which is itself based on the ideas in this paper:\n",
    "\n",

    "<em>A Framework for the Cooperation of Learning Algorithms</em>, 1990.\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about the cross-entropy loss.  The use of cross-entropy loss for neural network training has its roots root in the late-1980s realization that often the units of measurement that should be used by neural networks are units of probability, not only because of its elegance, but also its excellent performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "**In all your homework, you must explicitly cite any sources (people or any materials) you consult.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our class homework assignments, you should think about the problems yourself first before consulting outside help.  And when you do seek out help, we strongly advise you to find a fellow classmate to talk with and work together rather than copying an answer from the internet.  You will all learn much more by thinking collaboratively and explaining ideas to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you are alone and stuck and you find some really useful insight on Stack Overflow or Github or a blog or some chat channel thread on Discord, it is not cheating to use and learn from that insight <em>if you cite your sources</em>.  Learning from the internet is acceptable as long as you **do not misrepresent somebody else's work as your own**.  Include citations in your writeup text or in comments in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first exercise you will Google for a nice solution to a real problem and **make a proper citation of your source for the solution**.  In this specific problem you will only get points if you look it up and cite the source.  In general, avoid Googling and peeking at answers for homework problems, but in this problem we ask you to do it explicitly, and you should continue this practice of citing all your sources and collaborators in the future.  Linked citations are a very cool, polite, honest and useful practice in real life. In classwork, citations are *required*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: using tensors, and academic integrity in code\n",
    "\n",
    "You will remember the classic machine-learning idea of [k-nearest-neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we bring it to pytorch by implementing a k-nearest-neighbor function using parallel operations with pytorch tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have gathered a medium-size data set $D$ of $N$ vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D = \\{d_1, ..., d_N\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we have a small test sample $X$ containing $t$ test vectors,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\{x_1, ... x_t\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each test $x_i$, we wish to know the indexes of the $k$ vectors in $D$ which are closest to $X$, i.e., which have the smallest distances\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{knn}(x_i) = \\{j_1, j_2, ..., j_k\\} \\text{ such that $\\max_m || x_i - d_j ||$ is minimized}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $k$-nearest neighbor search is often used as a simple machine-learning baseline method to compare to other methods.  We want to implement it in in a simple brute-force way in pytorch, and we want to do it in parallel for all the $x_i$ at once, which will help exploit the GPU if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As background, here is a method that does it, with a little test case where the data set size is $|D| = 7$ and the test set size is $|X| = 4$."

    "2. Also **see how I have cited** my original source at the point where I have incorporated outside ideas.  If you compare the original code from the linked blog, you will see that I have changed the code a lot: it is in pytorch instead of numpy, variable names are changed, the whole notation is transposed, and I have altered many things.  *But it is still based on Trevino's idea, so I have still cited Trevino*.  Better yet, I have added my commentary about what Trevino did which was tricky.  (Of course I also got ideas from pytorch, but I did not cite pytorch itself, or the pytorch standard API documentation, because that is implicit when the code does an `import torch`.  If this were in a real project, it would be standard practice to cite pytorch when describing the code as a whole, instead of in little inline comments.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What's **not** so great here?  Even though it's clever, the code does more computation than necessary, and it is harder to read than necessary, because it does not take advantage of the ability for pytorch to broadcast vector subtraction, nor does it take advantage of the ability for pytorch to more quickly pull out the closest $k$ instead in a set of doing a full sort.  The cleverness in Trevino's method actuallly makes the code slower and harder to read than necessary.\n",

Plot the results and make sure it looks the same as `p1`. Add more calls to `torch.autograd.grad` to compute the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th derivatives, and plot the results, and make sure they look right.  The 2nd derivative should come from applying `grad` to the 1st derivative, and so on.

    "The modern conception of artificial neural networks is essentially the same as the model originally devised by [McCullough and Pitts in their seminal 1943 paper](https://papers.baulab.info/McCullochPitts-1943.pdf).  In that work, they observed that a biological neuron could be seen as an object that adds up its inputs, possibly weighting some inputs differently from others, and then firing an output only once some threshold is reached.  This can be modeled as a weighted sum followed by a nonlinearity:\n",

    "Decades after McCullough and Pitts, researchers like [Sarah Solla](https://papers.baulab.info/Solla-1988.pdf) and [John Hopfield](https://papers.baulab.info/also/Hopfield-1987.pdf) discovered that networks are very effective when trained to model *probabilities* instead of just discrete binary logic.  Even in the case where the output should make a choice between two alternatives, it is often best to have the network output its estimate of the *probability distribution* of the choice to be made, rather than just a 0 or a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in modern deep learning, we will often pursue the goal of matching some true vector of discrete probabilities $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by computing some model-predicted vector of probabilities $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that is derived from some raw neural network output $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and then measuring its deviation from some true distribution $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem of generating a predicted probability distribution $p$ to match some observed truth $y$ is is so central and common in deep networks that you should make sure you are very familiar with the specific clever functions that everybody uses to do it, and why this approach works so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling of $p$ and the measurement of the distance to $y$ is almost always done in the same way: **softmax** and **cross-entropy**.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the left we have some numbers $z$ that are computed with the intention of modeling some choices in the real world.  On the right we have a categorical probablity distribution $y$ that is the true distribution of the choices actually observed in the world.  (In our figure we have just drawn two choices, but a big model could estimate a distribution over hundreds or thousands of choices.)  In the middle, we have two steps.  First, $p$ is the result of using the \"softmax\" function to convert the arbitrarily-scaled numbers $z_i$ to nicely-scaled numbers $p_i$ between 0 and 1 that could be interpreted as a categorical probablity distribution.  Then to summarize the difference between the calculated $p$ and the true $y$, some loss $L$ is computed, where $L$ is a single number that will be small if the vectors $p$ and $y$ are close.  When working with categorical probabilities, $L$ is almost always the cross-entropy loss function, but other choices could be used.\n",

    "Below we introduce both the softmax and the cross-entropy (CE) loss function, and we also compare it to Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, as well as squared Euclidean vector distance, which is also known as the mean-squared-error (MSE) loss."

You should work to find simple expressions in terms of $p_1$ and $y_1$ instead of making a messy expression with the $z_i$.  To simplify terms, you may find it useful to remember thet $y_1 + y_2 = 1$ and $p_1 + p_2 = 1$.\n",

    "Negative CE and MSE applied to softmax have a lot of similarities, but they have some significant differences in their derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us visualize these derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and run the code below and interact with the widget.  It shows how the KL, CE, and MSE loss vary as a function of the logits.  If you click on the CE checkbox, you can see how negative cross entropy is parallel to the KL loss curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice how MSE is very different from KL. In particular, notice how MSE loss suffers from **vanishing graidents**: it saturates in regions where the predicted answer $p$ is far from the true answer $y$.  The flatness of the MSE loss means that it does not really distinguish between the quality of bad answers, and it can be hard to use MSE as a guide to improve a bad answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice that when the target probability $y$ is imbalanced, e.g., $y=0.1$, then MSE is also noticably flatter than KL at the point of minimum loss, with a much flatter curvature.  That means that MSE is very accepting of not-very-good answers whereas KL does a better job at distinguishing very-good answers from slightly less-good answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.4**. Plot and compare the partial derivatives of KL, and MSE on softmax as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, the plot on the right is incomplete because it does not include the correct plot of partial dervatives for KL and MSE losses.  Copy your answers from 3.3 into the proper lines of the code below to visualize the derivatives as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that CE has exactly the same shape as KL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots you make explain why cross-entropy loss typically works much better than MSE in practice.  While both KL and MSE are flat at the optimal point, unlike KL, MSE flattens out again when the logits are far from the optimal point.  We say that MSE *saturates* and suffers from a *vanishing gradient* when the system is far from the optimum.  Optimizations behave like a rolling stone: if you were to put a stone on the MSE loss curve, it could easily get stuck in the high flat area of the curve.  Whereas if you put a stone on the the KL loss curve, it would be on a steeper slope and roll quickly to the bottom."

    "\n",
    "In pytorch, a neural network is a `torch.nn.Module`, and every `torch.nn.Module` is a *callable* object that can be called just like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how to call `pipe.safetey_checker` you can consult the original Stable Diffusion code that calls it:  https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion.py#L166\n",
    "\n",
    "```image, has_nsfw_concept = self.safety_checker(images=image, clip_input=safety_cheker_input.pixel_values)```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the `safety_checker` network is expecting two inputs when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second `clip_input` argument is quite typical and conventional for a vision network.  It is a read-only 4-dimensional pytorch tensor that should contain the number data for a batch of normalized RGB images that the network will examine for possible offensive images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass a batch of 10 images as `clip_input`, you will need to normalize the data correctly - that is, you will need to paticular minimum and maximum numbers to represent the range from black pixels to white pixels, and you will want to use the same range that the network expects.  Since this is a \"CLIP\" network, it expects CLIP standard normalization as defined in the `clip_transform` in the code below (source is cited in the code).  Check the `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` documentation about how to use an image transform like this when loading data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `safety_checker` argument, `images`, is pretty unusual for a neural network, and we can almost ignore it.  It is a mutable list of numpy arrays for the image data, which the network will use to alter the original images to black out any suspected NSFW regions. (Most neural networks don't do mutations that alter their input data.)  Since we're not interested in blacking out anything for our test, we would prefer to ignore this argument, but it has to be supplied, so in the code below we create a `numpy_list` which you can provide as `images=numpy_list`, and then which you can then ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the code below to find any images in the `coco_humans` data set that are flagged by `safety_checker`.\n",
    " * Pass numpy_list and a single 10x3x224x224 pytorch tensor, correctly normalized, each time you call `pipe.safety_checker`.\n",
    " * You might need to make sure the tensor has a device data type that matches the network.\n",
    " * If any of the has_nsfw_concept flags come back `True`, then print the specific image number and display the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints and sanity checks: It is not a classification dataset, so all the data items have the same class number according to `ImageFolder`.  It should say that 1000 images are available in the data set; and if you examine image number 213 in the data set, you should see a slalom skiier.  A small handful of images will be flagged, including image number 162.  To display a flagged image, you could conver it back to a PIL image, or you could just create a second ImageFolder dataset, one for getting PIL image objects, and one for getting tensors.\n",
